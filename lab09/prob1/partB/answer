The Employee class has an method but it's not overriding the standard equals(Object obj) method from the Object class
This is a correct override of equals
    @Override
	public boolean equals(Object ob) {
		if (ob == null) return false;
		if (!(ob instanceof Employee)) return false;
		Employee e = (Employee)ob;
		return e.name.equals(name) && e.salary == salary;
	}
