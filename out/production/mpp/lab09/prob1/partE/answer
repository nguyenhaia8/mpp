i) In java, a class can inherit from only one superclass. This means that if D is a class and tries to
inherit from both B and C, where B and C both inherit from A, the compiler will issue an error. Because java
does not support multiple inheritance for classes

ii)
Java allows a class implement multiple interface. If D implements interface B and C, and both B and C
have a default method with same signature, then D must resolve conflict. Java 8 provides the default
keyword for interfaces, allowing them to provide method implementations. To resolve it, Java require
D to explicit override the method and use super.methodName() to specify which interface's implementation
want to use.
