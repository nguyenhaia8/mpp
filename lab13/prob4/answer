a)
The compiler error occurs on the last line nums.add(3.14).
When we declare a List<? extends Number>, it means it's a list of some specific but
unknown subtype of Number. Therefore, we cannot add anything to it (except null)
because the compiler can't guarantee type safety.

b)
The compiler error occurs on the last line double dbl = sum(ints). The sum method
expects a Collection<? extends Number>, but ints is of type List<? super Integer>.
